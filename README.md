### Lowest-Price-Finder

This application uses python, selenium, pandas and yagmail.

The app looks for new prices and, if the newer price is cheaper than the previous one, the dataframe is updated with the new and cheaper price and where it was found.

After looking and comparing all the prices, the dataframe is exported to a new .xlsx file.

Finally, an e-mail with the updated spreadsheet is sent to the user.
